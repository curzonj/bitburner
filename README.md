## Early game

1. run `scheduler.js` to get your hacking level up. This might not work, in
   which case run `brute-force.js` until your hacking level is `> 100`.
2. Once your hacking level gets higher then you'll run out of ram for hacking
   all the targets. run it with multiple `--targets` to balance between running
   out of memory sometimes and your memory all being unused.

## TODO

1. change `brute-force` to just weaken all the servers. Don't hack them until
   I have enough level to run `scheduler.js`
